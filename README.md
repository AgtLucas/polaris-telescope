# Polaris Telescope
    Access Polaris from Sketch to speed up your design or development workflow.


## Speed up your workflow
Sketch is our design tool of choice at Shopify. It supports the use of plugins to adapt to different kinds of workflows. While working with Polaris and Sketch, we found switching contexts between Sketch and polaris.shopify.com distracting and time consuming.

That’s why we created Polaris Telescope, a Sketch plugin that lets you search and view Polaris guidelines and code from right within Sketch.

Polaris Telescope can help you:

- Search for components and copy code directly from your design environment
- View our best practices and UX rationales while designing
- Save time by keeping your workflow within one window


## Type to search.
When nothing is selected, just type to search after you open the plugin.

## Select a layer for fast searching.
When a layer is selected or when you change your selection it will search again—based on the layer name—and display the best result immediately.

## Use it to grab code quickly.
This allows you, as a developer, to quickly grab and insert the basic react components. To quickly test those components you can use a playground in [polaris](https://github.com/shopify/polaris).

1. [Download the latest version and unzip the file](/docs/polarisInSketch.sketchplugin.zip?raw=true)

## Shortcuts

Auto search a layer name by selecting a layer within Sketch, and then opening Polaris Telescope. If you select a new layer it will automatically search again.
